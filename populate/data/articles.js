      '<p>Interviews are not only a time for you to sell yourself, but it is also a time to get to know the district. Typically at the end of an interview, the employer will ask “do you have any questions?”. It is easy for your mind to go blank when put on the spot after an hour-long conversation, so come prepared with a list. Below are ten examples of professional questions that can give you essential insight into the position and district!</p><p><strong>1.What type of population will I be working with? </strong></p><p>Special education postings typically do not describe the type of caseload or classroom you will be assigned in the vacant position. The interviewer may not always know the exact makeup of your potential workload, but you could learn information about what type of classrooms could be involved (i.e., general education, self-contained, etc.).</p><p><strong>2. What other special education professionals will I be working with on my team?</strong></p><p>This question allows you to gather what types of collaboration and professional resources you will have available on the job. Possibilities of team members could include speech-language pathologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, social workers, school psychologists, reading specialist’s, English Language Learning specialists, hearing itineraries, vision specialists, and nursing.</p><p><strong>3. How often does the special education team meet and collaborate?</strong></p><p>Team meetings are a valuable, dedicated time during the week to discuss challenging cases, prep for upcoming meetings and collaborate on students. Many districts will allow clinicians to block an hour out of their schedule during their week for this meeting.</p><p><strong>4. What is the district’s view on Inclusion?</strong></p><p>This question is essential to see if it aligns with your personal, professional values, as well as to understand how their special education environment spectrum works. Districts can have anything from leveled specialized self-contained programs to full inclusion with 1:1 aids within the genED classroom.</p><p><strong>5. How many schools will I be working at?</strong></p><p>This question applies to therapists and specialists who may have their caseload spread out between more than one school. Multi-school positions typically arise when a school needs a 1.5 or 2.5 professionals in a school based on caseload numbers. Therapists and specialists who are bilingual have increased the chance of being split between multiple buildings if the bilingual population is spread out across the district.</p><p><strong>6. Will there be other (name your profession) within the building I am working in?</strong></p><p>Having someone else who does your same job within a building is not a make or break, but it is nice to have the support and advice of a teammate who has the same skill set as you when the going gets tough. If there is no one else in your building who does what you do, are there other professionals in the district that they could connect you with for support?</p><p><strong>7. How does the school go about interacting with parents? </strong>(I.e., phone calls, dojo, seesaw, etc.)</p><p>There are different technology platforms that some districts use to have frequent and consistent communication with parents. If you are a specialist you will often stick to just phone calls, emails and face to face interaction. However, if you are a special education teacher, it is possible that a district will want you communicating with parents daily via apps that share pictures, comments, and behavioral feedback.</p><p><strong>8. What type of mentorship/support is given to first-year staff members?</strong></p><p>Whether you are in the first year of your profession or just the first year in the district, there can be a huge learning curve. It is great to know what type of mentorship you will receive to learn the ins and outs of the IEP technology and the district’s culture.</p><p><strong>9. How will I be evaluated as a first-year staff member?</strong></p><p>This question can help you learn about additional requirements you may have during the first year (i.e., turning in lesson plans, completing student progress summaries, observations, etc.). Of course, the way you are being evaluated typically won’t be a huge contributor to making a decision on which job to chose, but it is always good to be able to compare and contrast between districts.</p><p><strong>10. What are other ways that special education team members can get involved in the school community (i.e., additional duties during the school day)?</strong></p><p>Each district has a different culture around completing additional duties throughout the school day. Nonetheless, it is a great way to contribute to your school community and get involved. This can be a great time during the interview to share any additional skills you may have that can help lead a club during lunch or after school.</p><p>Always remember, the questions you ask should be things that you are genuinely curious about and dive deep into the information that can be found on the website and take the opportunity to learn more about your prospective employers!</p>',

      '<p>Congratulations, you have made it to the interview stage of the job hunt! Every school district conducts its hiring process differently, so it is essential to know the ins and outs of each interview setting. There are four main types of interviews you can get invited to phone interview, video conference interview, coffee shop interview, or an in-person interview. Below are some tips to get you prepared for each!</p><p><strong>Phone Interview</strong></p><p>Phone interviews are the first-step screener. They also may be scheduled if you are interviewing for a position that is out-of-town from your current location. Before your phone interview, make sure you find a quiet place with excellent phone service. Have your elevator speech practiced and prepared. Get organized with a printed copy of your resume to have as a quick reference for any questions they may ask about your experiences. Be sure also to keep a pen and paper handy to take notes throughout the interview.</p><p><strong>Video Conference Interview</strong></p><p>Like a phone interview, a video conference may be scheduled if it is logistically challenging to meet for an in-person interview. Before the meeting, make sure the platform they plan to use (i.e., Skype, zoom, facetime) is downloaded and working on your computer. You may want to try using it with a friend first to make sure your computer’s microphone works and technical issues do not get in the way of a successful interview. Be sure to choose your environment wisely for a video conference. Sitting against a blank wall with good lighting is always a safe bet!</p><p><strong>Coffee Shop Interview</strong></p><p>Coffee Shop interviews may be offered if there is not a secure place to meet within the district itself or the district is trying to meet you in a location that works best for you. Although coffee shops are seemingly casual, it is always important to still dress for success! Plan to get there early to avoid stress over any unexpected traffic delays or difficulties with parking. Once you arrive, work towards getting organized with your interview materials on the table and neatly tucking away any distractions (i.e., purse, jacket, phone).</p><p><strong>In-Person Interview</strong></p><p>An in-person interview can occur at any stage of the interview process. Some districts may even do a multi-step in-person interview with different people (i.e., principal, administration, colleagues). During an in-person interview be sure to dress business professional from head to toe. Have your phone turned on silent before you walk in the building, and only bring what you need (i.e., portfolio, purse). Your interview starts the moment you walk in the door, so professionalism is vital when greeting the secretary and waiting in the office for your interviewer to come.</p><p>Wherever your interview may be, remember that your professionalism is shown through your preparation, professional etiquette, and interview answers. Be confident, be you, and be ready to show off your best self!</p>',

A first-year staff member isn&rsquo;t expected to be perfect, but there are things that the SPED director will be looking for. Here are a few guidelines that can help you go from a first year to an experienced team member in no time!</p>\n<p><strong>Take the initiative with your students</strong>. This can mean anything from suggesting a new idea during a meeting to implementing a creative lesson plan to increase student engagement. Although it is just your first year, you also are the team member who has most recently been in a school which means you have been exposed to a vast body of research and several clinical observation. Put that new knowledge to good use!</p>\n<p>Even though you have just been a part of a rigorous university curriculum, the experience is an invaluable tool in the workplace. Ask questions to your mentors and team members to help gain perspective and expertise in challenging situations. Never be afraid to ask for help, when done proactively it can be seen as a sign of courage and strength.</p>\n<p>Typically, each SPED team will have a different culture surrounding paperwork preparation for IEP meetings. Although there is always a deadline, try your best to<strong> turn in paperwork before the deadline</strong>. This allows time for feedback and possible goal collaboration amongst team members. Your SPED director will appreciate never having to ask you for your work, and you will start excellent time management skills early in your career!</p>\n<p>During observations and problem-solving meetings, recommendations are given to support students in the classroom. Be sure to follow through with suggestions and document how they are progressing. This will show the director and the team that you take their feedback seriously and are open to new things that can help students reach their fullest potential.</p>\n<p>A huge part of finding success with the students in the classroom is parent follow through in the home. It can take time to build a trusting relationship with the parents of your students. SPED directors are looking for a professional who is willing to <strong>build relationships with parents throughout the year</strong>, so when the IEP meeting comes around, the parents feel comfortable and on board with the plan.</p>\n<p>Help your future SPED Director imagine how great you will be as part of their team and then apply these ideas once you have landed the job. Be confident, be you. You got this!</p>',

      '<p>If you are a Special Education Teacher reading this article, Thank you for all of your hard work! You chose a career that is as rewarding as it is difficult. As someone who teaches and meets common core standards, your job reaches so much further than that. Here are some things that your students are looking for in their teacher.</p><p><strong>Advocate</strong></p><p>Within the school setting, you know your students better than anyone. Be an advocate for them and their families by using a strengths-based model. Facilitate conversations about what they can do, versus their limitations. Encourage additional support when needed, and track what works best.</p><p><strong>Listener</strong></p><p>Students in the Special Education classroom can demonstrate a wide range of communication abilities. Be their listening ear to receive the verbal and non-verbal communications that may be difficult for an unfamiliar listener to interpret. Sometimes a student may need additional wait time or some extra support, but just like anyone the more they are acknowledged and heard the more they will reach towards their highest potential.</p><p><strong>Cheerleader</strong></p><p>A student in Special Education may not have a linear path of progress, but they are making small progress benchmarks of progress all the time. Be their cheerleader celebrating with them each step of the way. Every milestone met has taken a lot of hard work, and the positive reinforcement can keep up the motivation to continue growing.</p><p><strong>Pusher</strong></p><p>An influential teacher remembers that although a student may have made a lot of progress from where they started, there is always more skills that can be acquired. Your job along with the Special Education Team is to guide the student to the next step. Never settle for a student just being able to communicate the basics, figure out how to continue to let their personality and independence shine.</p><p><strong>Friend</strong></p><p>Sometimes being a student in Special Education can be very isolating. Although you always want to set firm boundaries and establish a structure within the classroom, it is also essential to be a friend to your students. Let them know that you care for them as people and are invested in your relationship. Greet them with kindness and be there when they are having a hard day.</p><p>Overall, there can be highs and lows in a school day, but through it all, your students are so lucky to have you by their side. Keep being a positive light for your students!</p>',
